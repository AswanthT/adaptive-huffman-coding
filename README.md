# Implementation of Adaptive Huffman Coding in C++ (Encoding and Decoding)
"adapt_huffman_dsa.cpp" contains the data structures and algorithms for realization of adaptive huffman coding tree, abstracted in a class "Tree".
The "main_encode.cpp" encodes the message taken as user input.
The characters in the input message string is assumed to be smaller case english alphabets (a-z) without any spaces in between.
"main_decode.cpp" decodes the code taken again as input from user.
The input code should contain only 1s and 0s.
